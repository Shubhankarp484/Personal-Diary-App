A **privacy-focused diary application** built with **Spring Boot** and **MongoDB Atlas**, where users can securely manage their personal diary entries.  

This project demonstrates industry-standard practices such as **RESTful API design, MVC architecture, authentication & authorization, unit testing, code quality monitoring, and CI-friendly tools**.  

---

## 🚀 Features  

- ✍️ **Diary Management (CRUD)** – Create, Read, Update, and Delete diary entries.  
- 🔐 **User Authentication** – Secure login with Spring Security + Basic Authentication.  
- 👥 **Role-based Authorization** –  
  - `USER`: Manage only their own diary entries.  
  - `ADMIN`: View and manage all users & their diary entries.  
- 📂 **MongoDB Atlas Integration** – Cloud-based NoSQL database for scalability.  
- ⚡ **RESTful APIs** – Clean API design with separation of concerns (Controller → Service → Repository).  
- 🛠 **Lombok Integration** – Boilerplate reduction for getters, setters, and constructors.  
- ✅ **Unit & Integration Testing** – JUnit 5 + Mockito for service and repository layers.  
- 📊 **Code Coverage & Quality** –  
  - [JaCoCo](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/) for test coverage reports.  
  - [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/) for code quality and maintainability checks.  
- ⚙️ **Configuration Management** – Used `application.yml` for cleaner configuration over `application.properties`.  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture  

The application follows **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design principles:  

- **Controller** – Handles incoming API requests.  
- **Service** – Business logic layer.  
- **Repository** – Interacts with MongoDB Atlas.  
- **Entity** – Represents data models (`User`, `DiaryEntry`).

- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas  
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, Mockito, JaCoCo, SonarQube  
- **Build Tool**: Maven  
- **Other Tools**: Lombok, Git/GitHub for version control

## 📡 API Endpoints  

### 🔓 Public APIs  
Accessible without authentication.  
- `POST /public/create-user` → Register a new user  
- `GET /public/health-check` → Health check endpoint  

### 👤 User APIs  
Require authentication. Regular users can only access their own data.  
- `PUT /user` → Update logged-in user details  
- `DELETE /user` → Delete logged-in user  
- `GET /users/me` → Get logged-in user details  

### 🛡️ Admin APIs  
Restricted to admin role.  
- `POST /admin/create-admin-user` → Register a new admin user  
- `GET /admin/all-users` → Get all registered users  

### 📖 Diary Entry APIs  
Authenticated users can manage their diary entries.  
- `POST /diary` → Create a diary entry  
- `GET /diary` → Get all diary entries of logged-in user  
- `GET /diary/{id}` → Get a specific diary entry  
- `PUT /diary/{id}` → Update a diary entry  
- `DELETE /diary/{id}` → Delete a diary entry

## 🧪 Testing & Quality  

- ✅ **JUnit 5 + Mockito** – Unit tests for service & repository layers.  
- 📊 **JaCoCo** – Ensures high test coverage.  
- 🧹 **SonarQube** – Ensures clean code, detects bugs, and improves maintainability.
